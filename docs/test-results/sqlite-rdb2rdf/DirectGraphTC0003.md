Three columns mapping, generation of a BlankNode

## Created SQL query
```sql
SELECT anon_1.s AS s,
       anon_1.p AS p,
       anon_1.o AS o
FROM
  (SELECT '_:Student#' || CAST(CAST("Student".rowid AS VARCHAR) AS VARCHAR) AS s,
          '<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>' AS p,
          '<http://example.com/base/Student>' AS o,
          NULL AS g
   FROM "Student"
   UNION ALL SELECT '_:Student#' || CAST(CAST("Student".rowid AS VARCHAR) AS VARCHAR) AS s,
                    '<http://example.com/base/Student#LastName>' AS p,
                    "Student"."LastName" AS o,
                    NULL AS g
   FROM "Student"
   UNION ALL SELECT '_:Student#' || CAST(CAST("Student".rowid AS VARCHAR) AS VARCHAR) AS s,
                    '<http://example.com/base/Student#FirstName>' AS p,
                    "Student"."FirstName" AS o,
                    NULL AS g
   FROM "Student"
   UNION ALL SELECT '_:Student#' || CAST(CAST("Student".rowid AS VARCHAR) AS VARCHAR) AS s,
                    '<http://example.com/base/Student#ID>' AS p,
                    '"' || CAST(CAST("Student"."ID" AS VARCHAR) AS VARCHAR) || '"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer>' AS o,
                    NULL AS g
   FROM "Student") AS anon_1
